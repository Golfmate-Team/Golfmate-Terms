* The Terms may not otherwise be modified except in writing by an authorized officer of GOLFMATE App/Website.

### 2. Services

* You must register as a member on the app in order to access and use Service.

* Service (or any features within the Service) may vary for different regions and countries. No warranty or representation is given that a particular Service or feature or function thereof or the same type and extent of the Service or features and functions thereof will be available for Users. GOLFMATE App may in our sole discretion limit, deny or create different level of access to and use of any Service (or any features within the Service) with respect to different Users.

### 3. User Account

By using the Services via GOLFMATE App, you will need to create a User Account by downloading the GOLFMATE App in customer version on either the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. You must be at least 18 years of age, to obtain an Account. If you choose to create ‘the Account’, you are required to create a password, or other secure login method, and provide GOLFMATE certain personal information, such as your name, mobile phone number, and at least one valid payment method. You must agree to maintain accurate, complete, and up to date information in your account. It is your responsibility to keep your password and / or other secure login method secretly in order to prevent others from accessing your email account or mobile phone. You must not authorize third parties to use your Account, and you may not allow persons under the age of 18 to receive coaching services from third party unless they are accompanied by you. Your account is not transferable, and you may only access or use the Services for unlawful purposes (e.g. no transport of unlawful or hazardous materials). If another person uses these methods to access your account, you will be responsible to pay any Classes they order, and GOLFMATE is not liable for any other losses you suffer, unless the person using your password obtained it in that we did not keep it secure.

You may close your account permanently at any time by logging out and remove GOLFMATE App from your device completely. We reserve the right to suspend your account, or close it permanently, if we believe that your account has been used unlawfully or by someone else. We may also close your account if in our opinion you are abusing our Services, for example, by applying for refunds or credit to which we do not consider you are entitled, making repeated unreasonable complaints, mistreating our staff, or any other good reason.

### 4. Placing Orders

When you place an order from any Coach through the GOLFMATE App, that order is fulfilled by the Coach and not by the Company. The Company is not responsible for the Coaching Services supplied by the Coach and has no responsibility or liability for acts or omissions by any Coaches. GOLFMATE has no responsibility or liability for acts or omissions by any Coaches other than as stated in this Agreement.

Once an order is placed via GOLFMATE App, a text message will be sent to your mobile for order confirmation within a short period of time. The contract for delivering your order will take effect when you received the order confirmation text message.

You are responsible for paying through your registered App account for all Classes ordered, even if you have ordered the Classes for someone else.

For any above listed reasons, should you have any special needs, you will need to contact the Coach directly.

### 5. Order Delivery

We do not provide Coaching Service directly and only act as an agent on behalf of the Coach to conclude your order from GOLFMATE App and to manage your experience via the order process. Once you placed an order, your Classes will be delivered to you by the Coach.

Under the below listed circumstances, you may be still charged for the ordered class and the delivery in the event of a failed delivery if you have caused such failure for any reason. Reasons that you might cause a delivery to fail include (but are not limited to) are as follows:

* You do not come to the class in the scheduled time.
* The Coach User suspects that your age is under 18 and refuses to deliver the Class to you when you are not accompanied.

### 6. Prices and Payment

* Prices include GST or other applicable consumption taxes outside Australia. You will need to understand that the prices from menu items displayed on GOLFMATE App may differ from the prices offered or published by the Coach for the same menu items and / or from prices available at other third – party websites, and that such prices may not be the lowest prices at which the menu items are sold. To the extent permitted by law, GOLFMATE has no obligation to itemise its costs, profits or margins when publishing such prices. GOLFMATE reserves the right to change such prices at any time, at its discretion. You are liable for all transaction taxes on the Services provided under this Agreement. GOLFMATE may operates dynamic pricing some of the time, which means prices of Classes may change while you are browsing. Prices may also change at any time at the discretion of the Coach (Coach user). GOLFMATE reserves the right to charge distinctive service fees on using online payment methods, which the service fees may be subject to change. Any applicable service fee is displayed on the App before you are finalizing your payment on the checkout page of the GOLFMATE App.
* Payment will be processed by the Company, using preferred payment method designated in your account. The most prevailing method of the payment when you place your order via the GOLFMATE App is to adopt the online payment method. We have partnered with several online payment service providers, by which you are able to use the specific online payment methods such as Visa, Master, and Apple Pay. Without a doubt, you can bind your Visa Card and Master Card to your Account to proceed with the payment in the GOLFMATE App. We act on behalf of the Coach (the Coach user) to collect the payment from you. The amount of the payment will include the Coach’s charges on the ordered classes plus the online payment surcharge. You may request a tax invoice via GOLFMATE App after the order has been completed. Upon your request, the tax invoice of the order will be sent to your email account which is linked to your GOLFMATE App account.
* By placing your order via the GOLFMATE App, you will be charged for the Class on a GST or other applicable consumption taxes exclusive basis. Charges will be inclusive of applicable taxes where required by law. Charged paid by you are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by GOLFMATE or required by the local consumer law. Refund Policy will be explained in Clause 9. You may be entitled to a refund for a major failure of the Services, or other remedies for a minor failure. All charges are due immediately and payment will be facilitated by GOLFMATE using your preferred payment method designated in your Account, after which GOLFMATE will send you a text message or in-app notifications to inform you the process and status of your order. If your preferred payment method is determined to be expired, invalid or otherwise not able to charge, you agree that GOLFMATE may use a secondary payment method in your Account, if available.

### 7. Cancellation

Your order can be cancelled without charge prior to the scheduled time. If you wish to cancel an order, please contact us by using the contact number in the Recitals immediately. You will not be charged for any orders cancelled by GOLFMATE or the GOLFMATE’s Coach User, and we will refund your payment using the same payment method which you have used for paying the order (excluding any discount, voucher that is applied to the order).

### 8. Refund and Return Policy

To the extent permitted by law, charges paid by you for completed and delivered orders are final and non-refundable and GOLFMATE has no obligation to provide refunds or credits. Nothing in this clause takes away from any rights you may have under the Australian Consumer Law.

You have a legal right to receive services which match their description as close as possible, which are of acceptable quality, and which comply with any specific requirements you tell us about (and we agree to) before you place your order. If you believe that the classes you have been delivered do not comply with these legal rights, please let us know as you have a legal right to have the issue remedied. We will remedy any failure in accordance with your legal rights. This may include providing a refund or account credit (in the form of voucher etc.) in respect of the affected, unless we have reasonable cause to believe that the problem was caused outside the delivery of classes. Prior to processing your refund or account credit, we may take into account relevant factors including the details of the order, your account history, the actual facts on delivery and information from the Coach when determining the remedy that will apply in the circumstances. This process may take at least 14 working days to complete.

GOLFMATE reserves to right to determine, within reasonable ground, appropriate compensation for errors made by GOLFMATE and the Coach User.

In the event that GOLFMATE and the Coach User are required to be jointly liable for the refund, GOLFMATE will reserve the right of final interpretation.
